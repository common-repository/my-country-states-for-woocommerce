== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I set up the plugin? =
No configuration required. All states are automatically for countries whose states are not implemeted in the WooCommerce.

= How can I customize the list of states for a country implemented by this plugin? =
You can customize the list of states for any country by using the `mcsfwc_states_of_{TWO_CHARACTER_COUNTRY_CODE_IN_LOWER_CASE}` filter hook provided by the plugin. For example, if you want to override the states for Afghanistan, use `mcsfwc_states_of_af` filter hook, for Singapore use `mcsfwc_states_of_sg` filter hook

= How can I customize the list of states for Afghanistan? =
The `mcsfwc_states_of_af` filter hook allows you to customize the list of states for Afghanistan in your WooCommerce checkout or other parts of your site where states are listed.

Here is an example of how to use the filter in your theme's `functions.php` file:

`<?php
function custom_afghanistan_states( $states ) {
    $states = array(
        'BDS' => 'Badakhshan',
        'BGL' => 'Baghlan',
        'BAL' => 'Balkh',
        // Add your custom states here
        'KAB' => 'Kabul',  // Example: Adding a custom state
    );
    return $states;
}
add_filter( 'mcsfwc_states_of_af', 'custom_afghanistan_states' );
?>`

= Is there any interface in Admin panel where I can customize the States listing? =
No, currently you can customize the  states list using the avaibale filter hooks. We are planning to implemente this feature in the next paid version.
